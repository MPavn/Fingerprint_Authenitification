# Fingerprint_Authenitification
by Maya Pavan and Emily Garceau

## Overview
This project designs and implements a simple fingerprint authentication system that can enroll users by processing their fingerprint images and verify their identity using the enrolled data


## Methodology

Our project developed a fingerprint authentication system that enrolled and verified users. The evaluation metrics calculated for our system revealed poor performance in both run time and accuracy. Potential improvements were identified, and future iterations of this project implementing these improvements would likely greatly improve the shortcomings of the current system.
This project deepened our understanding of the complex relationship between coding, biology, and security present in a biometric authentication system. Specifically, we learned the importance of efficient algorithms and data structures for big data, image processing techniques, removing noise from real-world data, fingerprint minutiae, and enrollment and matching techniques. We also realized the importance of evaluating system design and identifying potential improvements for future consideration.
